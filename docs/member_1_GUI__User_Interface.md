## Member 1 – GUI / User Interface

### Goal
My responsibility is to design and implement the **graphical user interface (GUI)** that allows the travel agent to interact with the Record Management System. The GUI should provide an intuitive interface for managing **client, airline, and flight records**.

### Responsibilities
- Designing the main application interface
- Creating forms for adding and editing records
- Displaying records to the user
- Connecting GUI actions to CRUD functions
- Ensuring user input is passed correctly to the backend logic

### Files
src/gui/main_window.py
src/gui/client_form.py
src/gui/airline_form.py
src/gui/flight_form.py

### How It Should Work
- Main window opens on application start
- Users can create, read, update, and delete records
- GUI calls CRUD functions directly using shared `records` list
- GUI does **not** handle storage logic

### Task List
1. Design main GUI layout  
2. Implement record input forms  
3. Connect GUI actions to CRUD functions  
4. Display records in the interface  
5. Provide user feedback for errors  

### Things to Watch Out For
- Avoid storage logic in the GUI  
- Validate user inputs  
- Update the interface after CRUD operations
